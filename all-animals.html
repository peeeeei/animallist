        <p class="desc">非洲最大陆生动物，群居温顺。 African Elephants are the world&#x27;s largest land animals, weighing up to (6.6 tons). They are one of the most unique-looking animals, too. With their characteristic long noses, or trunks; large, floppy ears; and wide, thick legs, there is no other animal with a similar physique. The African Elephant is an intelligent, sociable and familial animal, and despite the threat it attracts due to its Ivory, the great news is that numbers are up in Kenya over the last couple of years. They are found in large numbers in Amboseli and Masai Mara among other parks and reserves in Kenya. Read more about the African Elephant here.</p>

There are four subspecies of African Bufallo and Cape Bufallo is the most common of the four. They’re distinguished by coloring, size, and even horn shape. There’s also the forest buffalo, the West Africa savanna buffalo, and the Central Africa savanna buffalo. Buffalo are often pictured covered in mud with a bird on their back. The mud helps buffalo get rid of ticks and parasites that hasp onto their skin. Both Male and Female Bufallo has large horns which they use as weapon and for defense. African Bufallos have excellent eyesight, hearing, and a sense of smell that helps them detect the presence of lions, their greatest enemies. They communicate mostly through ritualized body movements and postures. These animals appears in great numbers in all major parks in Kenya, with the exception of Nairobi National Park.</p>

It is estimated that there are close to 2,000 in Kenya&#x27;s National Reserves and Parks. In Masai Mara National Reserve and surrounding conservancies that border the reserve the estimated number of lion population is close to 850 to 900. The &#x27;Mara&#x27; as it is also known is generally considered one of the best places in Kenya and East Africa to see these magnificent animals in the wild on a Safari. Individual Lions (males) can hold huge territories ranging from 30 to 400 square kilometers. The lionesses (females) take the lead when it comes to hunting down the prey. From time to time the Males will assist with a hunt. Read more about [Masai Mara Lions](https://www.masaimara.travel/lions-masai-mara.php) in detail at this page.</p>

Its distinguished by its well-camouflaged fur, opportunistic hunting behaviour, broad diet, strength, and its ability to adapt to a variety of habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe, including arid and montane areas. Leopards are spectacular hunters, famous for their incredible agility and strength to climb trees while dragging a kill that is sometimes heavier than their body weight and they can run at speeds of up to 58 kilometres per hour. Though Leopards can be found in healthy numbers in some the major parks in Kenya, these elusive animals are nonetheless listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by human encroachment and habitat loss. Leopards almost always hunt on their own and are by nature &#x27;shy&#x27;, preferring to hunt at night.</p>

Black Rhino are also more aggresive species compared to White Rhino, and they use their horns during mating and fighting, as well as when defending themselves from predators. They also use their hooked lip to browse shrubs and prefer thick bush habitat.</p>

They rely on camouflage to stay hidden, but can run at up to 70 kilometres (43 mi) an hour and sometimes leap vigorously sideways to break the scent trail they are leaving. African hares are 20 inches long, weighs between 1.5 to 3 kilograms (3.3 to 6.6 lb) and feeds on leaves, buds, roots, berries, fungi, bark and twigs.

And even with this missing digit, they can reach speeds between 40 and 50 miles per hour. The African Wild Dogs are listed as endangered species, mainly due to habitat loss and disease. In Kenya the populations in the wild are estimated to be between just three and five thousand. Laikipia- Samburu ecosystem is home to the largest population of wild dogs resident within Kenya, and the sixth largest wild dog population in the world! The largest populations are in Southern Tanzania, particularly in Nyerere National Park.

They are covered by a coat of brown or black hair, but their faces are bare except for a short white beard. Skin colour is generally white except for the face, hands, and feet, which are black. The faces of younger animals may be pinkish or whitish. Chimpanzees are highly social, intelligent, curious and noisy. They live in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. They exhibit complex patterns of behavior, many of which are learned, and can solve problems, plan for anticipated events, as well as make and use tools. They have even been seen utilizing medicinal plants for a variety of ailments. The chimpanzees are listed on the IUCN Red List as an endangered species; habitat loss, poaching, and disease being their biggest threats. They exits in large numbers in Ol Pejeta Chimpanzee Santuary, Kenya.</p>

        <p class="desc">群居活跃，常近水域。 Vervet Monkey also called savanna monkey, are the most widespread of the African monkeys and inhabit large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. They can be identified by their yellow to greenish-brown coat of hair. Their bellies are white, and they also have white fur on their brows and cheeks. Vervet society is built on complex but stable social groups (called troops) of 10 to 50 individuals—mainly adult females and their immature offspring. They eats a primarily herbivorous diet, living mostly on Leaves and young shoots- but bark, flowers, fruit, bulbs, roots and grass seeds are also consumed. The mainly vegetarian diet is supplemented with insects, grubs, eggs, baby birds and sometimes rodents and hares.</p>

          <p class="sci">Phacochoerus africanus</p>
        </div>
        <p class="desc">奔跑举尾，屈膝取食。 Warthogs are distributed throughout the savannah and semi-arid areas of sub-saharan africa. They are often seen in family groups, with parents and piglets trotting briskly in a straight line with tails erect. Warthogs have the peculiar habit of kneeling on the front knees while feeding and foraging in a localised area. They are herbivores and diurnal animals that spend much of their day foraging for food. Their most endearing habit is the way they turn tail and trot away with their thin tufted tails stuck straight up in the air like some antenna. Best places to see them in Kenya are in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Nairobi and Amboseli National Parks. They are the most common wild pig in Kenya and the most frequently observed wild pig in Africa.</p>

        <p class="desc">大迁徙主角，群体庞大。 Wildebeest is a member of the antelope family. The front end of its body is heavily built, while the hindquarters are slender with spindly legs, making it look more bovine. Wildebeests have a gray coat and a black mane as well as a beard that can be black or white. They travel in large herds and are active day and night, grazing constantly. The species forming the large herds of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem of Kenya and Tanzania is known as the western white-bearded wildebeest. Their favourite habitats are open woodlands and open grassy plains. The famous [Wildebeest Migration](https://www.masaimara.travel/wildebeest-migration.php) which occurs across Serengeti and Masai Mara is named after this animals as Wildebeest make up the majority of the migrating herds of animals which trek up north from Serengeti into Masai Mara every July to Septermber.</p>
