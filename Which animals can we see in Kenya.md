**Which animals can we see in Kenya**

**Kenya Safari Animals**

Kenya has a magnificent collection of wildlife protected in national parks and reserves across the country. See below a list of animals you can see during a Kenya Safari including close to one hundred mammals and over 400 species of birds which can be seen in places such as Masai Mara, Lake Nakuru, Amboseli, Tsavo, Samburu and Ol Pejeta Conservancy.

**Big Five Animals List**

Many tourists ask what does the Big Five list of animals mean, as they hear about it while planning their Safari to Kenya. Well this is a traditional Kenyan classification of five wild animals which are on most people's wish list, namely the Lion, Elephant, Rhino, Leopard and Buffalo. We have listed brief details on each of these animals below.

**Elephant（非洲象）( Loxodonta Africana )**
非洲最大陆生动物，群居温顺。

African Elephants are the world's largest land animals, weighing up to (6.6 tons). They are one of the most unique-looking animals, too. With their characteristic long noses, or trunks; large, floppy ears; and wide, thick legs, there is no other animal with a similar physique. The African Elephant is an intelligent, sociable and familial animal, and despite the threat it attracts due to its Ivory, the great news is that numbers are up in Kenya over the last couple of years. They are found in large numbers in Amboseli and Masai Mara among other parks and reserves in Kenya. Read more about the African Elephant here.

**African Buffalo（非洲水牛）( Syncerus caffer )**

African Bufallo is one of the ´´Big Five´´ and is often referred to as one the most dangerous animals in Africa. There are four subspecies of African Bufallo and Cape Bufallo is the most common of the four. They’re distinguished by coloring, size, and even horn shape. There’s also the forest buffalo, the West Africa savanna buffalo, and the Central Africa savanna buffalo. Buffalo are often pictured covered in mud with a bird on their back. The mud helps buffalo get rid of ticks and parasites that hasp onto their skin. Both Male and Female Bufallo has large horns which they use as weapon and for defense. African Bufallos have excellent eyesight, hearing, and a sense of smell that helps them detect the presence of lions, their greatest enemies. They communicate mostly through ritualized body movements and postures. These animals appears in great numbers in all major parks in Kenya, with the exception of Nairobi National Park.

**Lion（狮子）( Panthera Leo)**
群居顶级捕食者，雌狮主攻。

Lions are the largest of Africa's big cats and the only cats that live in groups, which are called prides. It is estimated that there are close to 2,000 in Kenya's National Reserves and Parks. In Masai Mara National Reserve and surrounding conservancies that border the reserve the estimated number of lion population is close to 850 to 900. The 'Mara' as it is also known is generally considered one of the best places in Kenya and East Africa to see these magnificent animals in the wild on a Safari. Individual Lions (males) can hold huge territories ranging from 30 to 400 square kilometers. The lionesses (females) take the lead when it comes to hunting down the prey. From time to time the Males will assist with a hunt. Read more about [Masai Mara Lions](https://www.masaimara.travel/lions-masai-mara.php) in detail at this page.

**Leopard（非洲豹）(Panthera pardus )**

Leopards are spectacular hunters, famous for their incredible agility and strength to climb trees while dragging a kill that is sometimes heavier than their body weight and they can run at speeds of up to 58 kilometres per hour. Though Leopards can be found in healthy numbers in some the major parks in Kenya, these elusive animals are nonetheless listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by human encroachment and habitat loss. Leopards almost always hunt on their own and are by nature 'shy', preferring to hunt at night.

Black Rhino are also more aggresive species compared to White Rhino, and they use their horns during mating and fighting, as well as when defending themselves from predators. They also use their hooked lip to browse shrubs and prefer thick bush habitat.

**The Big Nine Animal List in Kenya**

The Big 9 are essentially the Big Five animals above with the addition of the Cheetah, Giraffe, Zebra and Hippopotamus. Masai Mara is one of the few places in Kenya and East Africa where all of the Big Nine wildlife may be spotted on single game drive of 2 to 3 hours.
